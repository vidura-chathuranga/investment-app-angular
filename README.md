# Investment App

This is my second Angular project, built to practice and explore various Angular concepts and architectures. The project demonstrates the following:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Implementation of Angular components for modular and reusable design.  
- **Event Emitters & Property Binding**: Communication between parent and child components.  
- **Two-Way Binding**: Synchronizing data between templates and component classes.  
- **Forms Module**: Creating and managing forms efficiently.  
- **Currency Pipes**: Formatting currency values in the application.  
- **Services and Models**: Sharing data and structuring the application.  
- **Modern Angular Features**: Practiced using Signals, Input, and Output for state management.  
- **Standalone Components to Module-Based Migration**: Learned and implemented how to transition between standalone components and traditional module-based components.  

## Branch Details

- **Main Branch**  
  Contains code with standalone components using event emitters and property binding.  

- **`migrate-to-signals` Branch**  
  Migrates the application to use Signals along with Input and Output functions for state changes instead of traditional methods.  

- **`migrate-to-modules-from-standalone` Branch**  
  Demonstrates the migration from standalone components to a traditional module-based architecture.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.10.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
